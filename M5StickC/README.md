# [M5StickC](https://m5stack.com/products/stick-c) firmware

This is the v1.6.5.1 firmware for the M5StickC and the software to 'burn' (flash) the firmware.

This is a copy because the download was SO freaking slow.

# Howto
Place `UIFlow_StickC-v1.6.5.1.bin` in the `M5Burner\packages\fw\stickc` folder and restart the **M5Burner** program.

# ESP32 die shot

I've added an upscaled `die shot` (as they call it). Original version is from https://www.cnx-software.com/2017/02/06/oh-look-espressif-esp32-die-shot-thats-pretty/

# Hashes

**Optional:** If you know know what these are you'll know what to do with these. *If you don't, don't sweat it* :-)
