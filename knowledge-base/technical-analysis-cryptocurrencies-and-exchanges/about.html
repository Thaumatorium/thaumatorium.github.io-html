		<h2><a id=history href=#history-and-context class=self-link>History and context</a></h2>
		<p>I know about crypto since 2010-ish, back when Bitcoin was the only coin in town. I always wanted to buy some, but never had money left to spend, due to either no income (because student) or because my job wasn't paying enough and I had to pay off my student loans (which weren't <em>that</em> big back then - not compared to what I have now, lmao).</p>
		<h2><a id=history href=#cryptocurrencies class=self-link>Cryptocurrencies</a></h2>
		<p>Since a few months (basically around the start of 2021 - the second year of the Corona pandemic) I've been informing myself about cryptos other than Bitcoin, which one are interesting, which ones are prone to grow well, and I think I've found a handful that have interested me.</p>
		<h2><a id=history href=#exchanges class=self-link>Exchanges</a></h2>
		<p>I don't just want to buy crypto, I plan to buy and sell them to make money. In other terms: Trading.</p>
		<p>To trade you'll need an exchange: a place where you <em>exchange</em> one coin for another. I'm careful not to say <em>currency</em>, because currencies are recognized by governments as legal tender, which not all, if not none, of crypto is. In concrete terms: calling it currency is disingenuous, because in my country (the Netherlands) none of them are.</p>
		<p>The ones I chose for now are Bitvavo and Binance.</p>
		<p>Bitvavo, because it's Dutch and lately, partially because of China's political power, but that's a whole nother can of worms I'm not willing to open here, I've been on a streak to support Dutch companies over any other. This may sound a bit too Nationalistic, but that's because I usually simply don't even know where a company is from, which is something I think we (the Netherlands and Europe) can't affor in the long run.</p>
		<p>Binance, due to name recognition on Reddit. I spend quite some time on it, even though I'm hypercritical of it, and have found Binance to be named quite often. Binance is based in Malta, a European island, though its origins were Chinese. I'm aware the creator is also of Chinese origin (Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ on twitter), but I don't value people on their origin - I base their value on what they did, and he got the fuck out and made one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.</p>
		<p>I use both of these - Bitvavo if it has the coin, with Binance as the alternative.</p>
