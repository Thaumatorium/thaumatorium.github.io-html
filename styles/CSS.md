# CSS documentation

Since I'm relatively new, I'll document some information. No guarantee I'm actually using it though.

## Glossary

| Abbreviation | Description     |
|--------------|-----------------|
| RHS          | Right Hand Side |
| LHS          | Left Hand Side  |

## Attributes

You can always prepend `[attr]` with a tag or class name. If none is provided, the `universal selector (*)` is assumed.

`*[hreflang|=en]` and `[hreflang|=en]` are equivalent,
`*.warning` and `.warning` are equivalent,
`*#myid` and `#myid` are equivalent.

### h1[attr]

`attr` exists within `h1`

### div[attr=val]

`attr` exists within a `div` and is exactly `val`

### [attr~=val]

Some `attr` contains a space-separated list of words, one of which is exactly `val`

### [attr|=val]

Some `attr` exists and starts with `val`. `val` may be followed by a `-` and some more text.

Can be used for grouping? At least for languages: `[attr|=en]` would encapsulate `attr=en` and `attr=en-GB`

### [attr^=val]

`attr` starts with `val`. Yes, just like regex.

### [attr$=val]

`attr` ends with `val`. Yes, just like regex.

### [attr*=val]

`attr` contains at least one `val`. Not like regex - regex uses `+` for that.

## Combinators

### LHS>RHS

Child combinator
This means the RHS is a **direct** child of LHS

``` HTML
<LHS>
    <RHS />
</LHS>
```

### LHS RHS

Descendant combinator
RHS is some descendant of LHS (could be very shallow *or* very deep into the DOM &ndash; it doesn't matter)

``` HTML
<LHS>
    <one-or-more-levels-deep>
        <RHS />
    </one-or-more-levels-deep>
</LHS>
```

### LHS+RHS

Next-subling combinator
RHS follows RHS. In other words: RHS sits *directly below* LHS.

``` HTML
<LHS></LHS>
<RHS></RHS>
```

### LHS~RHS

Subsequent-sibling combinator
RHS follows RHS with more tags between. In other words: RHS sits *somewhere below* LHS.

``` HTML
<RHS></RHS>
<one-or-more-tags />
<LHS></LHS>
```
